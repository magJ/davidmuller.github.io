### Frequently Asked Questions

**Why CopyHistory App and not another clipboard manager?**

There are a number of clipboard managers available, but I wanted one that was distributed on the mac app store, ignored content from my password manager, cost a reasonable amount, did not sync my data anywhere, and highlighted text as I searched for it. CopyHistory App can help you be more productive, I hope you give it a try.
